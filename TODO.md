# TODOs

* **The code is kinda ugly.**
	* Figure out a good way to break the code up - namespaces, etc.
	* Better naming?
	* Some docstrings would be nice
* Upload to clojars so that it can be included in a project that's trying to achieve a specific task.
* Figure out how to make the list-entries lazy. There's gotta be a way.
* More documentation as the high-level defns get fleshed out.
* Tests? Yeah, probably.
